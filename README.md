# Wild West Royale

Small object-oriented javascript application of a Battle Royal-style text-fighter game. Leaving as a future project idea to integrate with React or as a React/Angular learning exercise.

Basic gameplay currently is that you select a character, then select an enemy. Upon selecting an enemy you can attack, but are immediately counter-attacked. The goal is to defeat all enemies before your health points run out. 

As a strategy, your health continuously goes down but your attack power goes up with each successful hit. Each enemy has varying health points and counter-attack power, but their counter-attack power remains the same during an entire match.
